## üìÑ REQUIRED DOCUMENTS (Generate ALL That Apply)

### üö® CRITICAL RULE: ONLY Generate Required Documents

**Cursor MUST follow this rule strictly:**
- **ONLY generate documents that are REQUIRED based on codebase analysis**
- **NEVER generate documents for features that don't exist**
- **NEVER create "just in case" or "future-proof" documents**
- **NEVER assume features exist - verify through exhaustive codebase analysis**

### Universal Requirements (Generate for EVERY app):
1. **Privacy Policy** - Based on detected data collection methods
2. **Terms of Service** - Based on detected service features
3. **General Disclaimer** - Based on detected business type

### Conditional Requirements (Generate ONLY if detected):
4. **Cookie Policy** - ONLY if cookies, analytics, or tracking detected
5. **Affiliate Disclosure** - ONLY if affiliate programs or sponsored content detected
6. **Returns & Refunds** - ONLY if e-commerce or payment processing detected

### üîç Verification Process:
Before generating ANY document:

2. **Multiple verification methods** (grep, file search, code analysis)
3. **Clear evidence** that the feature exists and is implemented
4. **Documentation** of where and how the feature is used
5. **User confirmation** if any ambiguity exists

**Example of CORRECT approach:**
- ‚úÖ "Cookies detected in codebase: authentication, consent, session management ‚Üí Generate Cookie Policy"

**Example of INCORRECT approach:**
- ‚ùå "Generate all possible documents to be safe"
- ‚ùå "Create documents for features that might exist"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL WARNING: DOCUMENT GENERATION RULE

### üö® THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE:

**ONLY GENERATE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY REQUIRED BASED ON YOUR CODEBASE ANALYSIS.**

**What this means:**
- ‚úÖ **DO generate** documents for features you can PROVE exist in the code
- ‚ùå **DON'T generate** documents for features you think might exist
- ‚ùå **DON'T generate** documents "just to be safe"
- ‚ùå **DON'T generate** documents for future features
- ‚ùå **DON'T generate** documents because they're common in similar apps

**Verification requirement:**
- You must have **concrete evidence** from the codebase
- You must be able to **point to specific files/code** that implement the feature
- You must **document your findings** in the prep questions
- If in doubt, **ASK the user** before generating

**Example of what NOT to do:**
- "This is an educational app, so I'll generate an E-commerce Policy just in case"
- "Most apps have analytics, so I'll generate an Analytics Policy"
- "Better safe than sorry - I'll generate all possible documents"

**Example of what TO do:**
- "I found cookie consent code in components/cookie-consent.tsx ‚Üí Generate Cookie Policy"
- "I found YouTube API integration in lib/utils/youtube-helpers.ts ‚Üí Generate DMCA Policy"
- "No payment processing detected in codebase ‚Üí Do NOT generate Returns & Refunds Policy"

**Remember:** It's better to generate **FEWER, ACCURATE documents** than to generate **MORE, IRRELEVANT documents**.

*Generated documents will be saved in the `generated-docs/` folder with clear naming conventions and metadata.*
