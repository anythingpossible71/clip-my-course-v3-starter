# terms-template.md
> Purpose: Drive Cursor to auto-generate **Terms of Use** from your actual codebase + a few minimal answers, and highlight any **legal/compliance gaps** in your implementation.

---

## 🔧 How to use (Cursor, read carefully)
1) Scan repository to auto-detect items in **Auto-Detect Matrix**.  
2) Ask me **only** the questions in **Minimal Questions** that you cannot infer.  
3) Validate using **Sanity Checks**. If conflicts → show a short diff + ask me to resolve.  
4) Generate `./legal/terms-of-use.md` (Markdown) matching **Output Spec** exactly.  
5) After drafting, produce a **Gaps & Recommendations** section that points out missing app features that reduce legal defensibility.

## 🕳️ Gaps & Recommendations (new section)
Cursor: After scanning, compare detected facts vs. the following checklist.  
For each ❌ gap, output a ⚠️ note under this section.

### User Rights
- ❌ No “Delete My Account” route found → ⚠️ Risk: GDPR/CCPA expect deletion rights.  
- ❌ No “Export My Data” route found → ⚠️ Risk: DSAR rights may be unsatisfiable.  

### Payments & Refunds
- ❌ Payments detected but no refund/cancellation policy → ⚠️ Risk: consumer protection claims.  
- ❌ Trials auto-renew with no cancellation → ⚠️ Risk: unfair contract terms.  

### Content & Moderation
- ❌ UGC features detected but no moderation/report tools → ⚠️ Risk: liability for harmful/illegal content.  

### Security
- ❌ No encryption library detected → ⚠️ Risk: data breach liability.  
- ❌ No HTTPS enforcement → ⚠️ Risk: insecure transmission.  

### Third-Party Services
- ❌ Ad/analytics SDKs found but not disclosed → ⚠️ Risk: misleading privacy/terms.  

### General
- ❌ No governing law/jurisdiction set → ⚠️ Risk: unenforceable terms in disputes.  
- ❌ No minimum age policy → ⚠️ Risk: children’s privacy laws (COPPA, GDPR).

## ✅ Generation Rules
- Do not hallucinate providers or features.  
- If uncertain, ask a single consolidated clarifying message with your proposed defaults.  
- Remove unused placeholders and empty lines in the final file.  
- Include a one-line changelog footer: `_Generated by Cursor from codebase context: {{iso_datetime}}_`.
