# privacy-template.md
> Purpose: Drive Cursor to auto-generate a **Privacy Policy** from your actual codebase + minimal admin input, and highlight any **gaps** that may create compliance risks.

---

## üîß How to use (Cursor, read carefully)
1) Scan repository to auto-detect items in **Auto-Detect Matrix**.  
2) Ask me **only** the questions in **Minimal Questions** that you cannot infer.  
3) Validate with **Sanity Checks**. If conflicts ‚Üí show a short diff + ask me to resolve.  
4) Generate `./legal/privacy-policy.md` (Markdown) matching **Output Spec**.  
5) After drafting, include a **Gaps & Recommendations** section pointing out missing features that weaken compliance.
