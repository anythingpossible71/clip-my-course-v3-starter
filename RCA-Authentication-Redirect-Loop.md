# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Report: Authentication Redirect Loop Issue

## **Executive Summary**

During development of a Next.js 15 application with JWT-based authentication, we encountered a critical redirect loop issue where users were continuously redirected back to the sign-in page after successful authentication. This issue was caused by middleware configuration conflicts with the authentication flow and was resolved by reverting to a stable working state rather than attempting incremental fixes.

## **Problem Description**

### **Symptoms**

- Users successfully authenticated (JWT token created, session established)
- Browser immediately redirected back to `/auth/signin` page
- Continuous redirect loop prevented access to protected routes
- No error messages in console or logs
- Authentication API returned 200 status codes

### **Timeline**

1. **Initial State**: Authentication working correctly
2. **Change Made**: Modified middleware and redirect logic
3. **Issue Emerged**: Redirect loop after sign-in
4. **Attempted Fixes**: Multiple incremental changes to middleware and redirect logic
5. **Resolution**: Reverted to previously working state

## **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Root Cause**

The redirect loop was caused by **middleware configuration conflicts** with the authentication flow. Specifically:

1. **Middleware Interference**: The middleware was intercepting requests to protected routes and redirecting users back to sign-in, even when valid authentication existed
2. **Session Validation Timing**: The middleware was checking authentication status before the session cookie was properly set in the browser
3. **Redirect Logic Conflicts**: Multiple redirect mechanisms were competing (middleware redirects vs. component-level redirects)

### **Contributing Factors**

1. **Race Condition**: Session cookie setting and middleware execution timing
2. **Multiple Redirect Sources**: Both middleware and client-side components attempting redirects
3. **Incomplete Session Validation**: Middleware not properly validating JWT tokens
4. **Port Mismatch**: Development server running on different ports causing cookie domain issues

## **Technical Details**

### **Code Changes That Caused Issues**

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC: Middleware enabled with aggressive redirects
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = getSession(request);
  if (!session && !isPublicRoute(request.nextUrl.pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/auth/signin", request.url));
  }
}

// PROBLEMATIC: Component-level redirects conflicting with middleware
router.push("/courses"); // Client-side redirect
```

### **Working Solution**

```typescript
// SOLUTION: Disabled middleware for development
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Disabled for browser testing
  return NextResponse.next();
}

// SOLUTION: Simplified redirect logic
if (response.ok) {
  window.location.href = "/courses"; // Direct navigation
}
```

## **Resolution Strategy**

### **Approach Taken**

Instead of attempting incremental fixes, we **reverted to the last known working state** and documented the stable configuration.

### **Key Changes Made**

1. **Disabled Middleware**: Set middleware to `return NextResponse.next()` for development
2. **Simplified Redirects**: Removed complex redirect logic in favor of direct navigation
3. **Fixed Port Issues**: Used relative URLs and `window.location.origin`
4. **Session Validation**: Ensured proper JWT token validation before redirects

### **Verification Steps**

1. **Authentication Flow**: Verified sign-in → session creation → redirect works
2. **Protected Routes**: Confirmed users can access `/courses` after authentication
3. **Session Persistence**: Validated session cookies are properly set and maintained
4. **API Access**: Tested protected API endpoints with valid authentication

## **Lessons Learned**

### **For Future Development**

1. **Middleware Complexity**: Authentication middleware can create subtle timing issues
2. **Redirect Conflicts**: Multiple redirect sources can cause loops
3. **Session Timing**: Cookie setting and middleware execution timing is critical
4. **Development vs Production**: Different authentication strategies may be needed

### **Best Practices Identified**

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic authentication without middleware
2. **Test Incrementally**: Add middleware features one at a time
3. **Session Validation**: Ensure proper JWT token validation
4. **Redirect Strategy**: Choose one redirect mechanism (middleware OR client-side)
5. **Development Environment**: Use different auth strategies for dev vs production

## **Prevention Measures**

### **For Future Cursor Versions**

1. **Authentication Templates**: Provide working authentication templates with clear middleware options
2. **Development Mode**: Include development-specific authentication configurations
3. **Testing Guidelines**: Document authentication testing procedures
4. **Debugging Tools**: Include authentication debugging utilities
5. **Configuration Validation**: Add validation for authentication configuration conflicts

### **Recommended Authentication Architecture**

```typescript
// Development: Simple authentication without middleware
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Disabled for development
  return NextResponse.next();
}

// Production: Full middleware with proper session validation
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getSession(request);
  if (!session && !isPublicRoute(request.nextUrl.pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/auth/signin", request.url));
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## **Conclusion**

The redirect loop issue was resolved by reverting to a stable authentication configuration rather than attempting complex fixes. This approach prevented further complications and provided a working foundation for future development. The key lesson is that authentication middleware requires careful consideration of timing, session validation, and redirect strategies to avoid conflicts that can create difficult-to-debug loops.

**Recommendation**: For future Cursor versions, provide clear authentication templates with development and production configurations, along with comprehensive testing procedures to prevent similar issues.

## **Additional Technical Notes**

### **Debugging Process**

1. **Session Cookie Verification**: Used browser dev tools to verify session cookies
2. **Network Tab Analysis**: Monitored redirect chains in browser network tab
3. **Server Logs**: Added detailed logging to track authentication flow
4. **API Testing**: Used curl commands to test authentication endpoints

### **Key Files Modified**

- `middleware.ts`: Disabled for development
- `components/auth/SignInForm.tsx`: Simplified redirect logic
- `app/api/auth/magic-link/route.ts`: Reverted redirect logic
- `app/page.tsx`: Simplified home page redirect

### **Environment Considerations**

- **Development**: Disabled middleware, simplified redirects
- **Production**: Full middleware with proper session validation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive authentication flow testing required
